When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

 When you want to share your repository with others. when you want to make changes to the repository from a different computer.
 When you want to share your project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is better to manually pull changes because you can choose the branches that you want to pull and you can choose if you want to pull these changes in the first place.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of repositories on github. Clones are copies of repositories, these can be local copies or copies from github. Branches are the current place where your commits are saved. You use branches to get to commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	When this copy you can compare with your master to see if you would like to merge these changes with your master branch. You can also view the changes and the differences between files.   

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would collaborate using google drive and share my source code allowing it to be edited by the collaborator. It would be easier to make changes like this. It would also be harder to track changes unless the collaborator explicitly says where they made their changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   When you are working on an experimental feature or when you are collaborating and are not sure if your partner will approve your changes.
