How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to view the lines that were different and where they were.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    So you can go back and see where you made certain changes to be able to see where problems arise.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    If you manually choose you get more control over the save points. The cons are that you may forget to commit and have a large number of changes between commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because many times two files are dependent on one another. In other version control systems the dependency is not important because of the nature of the work being saved.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
	Git log in order to have a history of all the versions made and git diff to compare the differences between multiple versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
	Because you will be able to go back and test previous versions to see where any bugs were introduced using git checkout.    

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
